def Device('name')
	click create new device button
	register new device screen pops up (done in javascript)
	type in name: 'Device-name-1'
	define data type(note this app only handles 1-dimensional, numerical data): 'Temperature' 
		(creates DataLog instance with Device-name-1 as ForeignKey)
	would you like to add another data type?
	If yes, define new data type which will create another DataLog instance with 
		the same Device ForeignKey
	first device will be 'Random-Device' and will have two DataLog instances tied to it with
		data_type 'random-1' and 'random-2'. 

def DataLog(device.object.name, data_type)
	called during create new device process or under an individual device's settings to create new
		instance with a user-defined data_type.

	constantly accessed to add new data to array

def SubmitRandom(num-1, num-2)
	called after hitting the submit button in the random number widget
	log-1 = DataLog.objects.get(name='Random-Device', data_type='random-1')
	log-2 = DataLog.objects.get(name='Random-Device', data_type='random-2')
	log-1.push(num-1)
	log-2.push(num-2) //adds num-1 and num-2 to their respective logs
	cause histograms and statitics for random data to display
