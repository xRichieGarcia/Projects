ToDo:

I want a graph that shows the toal number of times each number between 0,10 has been chosen. I have an array of the form num1= [1,1,2,4,2,1,0,8,7,10] coming from my database
(var num1= "{{num1}}"; // introduces python variable to javascript file
my histogram array should then be count1= [1,3,2,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1].
Something like:
cnt = Counter()
for i in num1:
	cnt[i] += 1
cnt

output ---> Counter({0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 2,....})

for (i in range(21)):
	count1[i]= num1.count(i-10)

Right now populateArray uses a double for loop to create the vaules of each bar. in the first level, tmp is reset to an empty array tmp = []; In the second loop the info for one graph is placed in the array one at a time using tmp.push(random_num)

series is the number of graphs i'm making. serieLength is how many bars each chart will have. 

for (var i range(21):
	phaseSpace[i] = i-10

Make the histogram look pretty

Tie to database

Tie to website

Make the submit button create and instance of the class InputLog with the 2 text box results as the inputs. Use a form with two integer input fields and an action that calls InputLog(num1, num2) which saves a new data pair to our database.

graph-1 = InputLog.num1.all();
graph-2 = InputLog.num1.all();

Display all the instances of InputLog as a histogram

Hide the histogram until some guesses are submitted
